                            Linus Torvalds created the
                            <strong>Linux kernel</strong> as a personal project
                            while he was a student, which he still oversees.
                            It's the main part of the Linux operating system.

                            development for version control. Torvalds created it
                            to manage Linux's development and it's now widely
                            used.
